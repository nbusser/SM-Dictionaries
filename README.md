## Base dictionaries

These dictionaries are given as parameter to [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/Montreal-Forced-Aligner).

Four different languages are supported for the moment:

- [English](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/mfa-models/blob/master/dictionary/english.dict)
- [German](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/mfa-models/blob/master/dictionary/german_prosodylab.dict)
- [Spanish](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/mfa-models/raw/master/acoustic/spanish.zip): handcrafted dictionary; may lack of precision.
